<h3>Install packages</h3>

Install `tidyverse` and `Seurat` packages from the RStudio Packages tab or by copy-pasting
the following in the Console:

~~~
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "Seurat"), dependencies = TRUE)
~~~
{: .r}

Once the installation has finished, load the libraries to verify that both packages
installed correctly.

~~~
library(tidyverse)
library(Seurat)
~~~
{: .r}

<h3>Data files and project organization</h3>

1. Create a new project called `scRNA`.
    - Click the `File` menu button, then `New Project`.
    - Click `New Directory`.
    - Click `New Project`.
    - Type `scRNA` as the directory name. Create the project anywhere you like,
      but don't forget where you put it!
    - Click the `Create Project` button.
    This will create a file called `scRNA.Rproj` in the directory you just
    created. In the future you can double-click on this file to open
    `RStudio` in this directory. This will be the easiest way to interact
    with the files/code you produce in this workshop.

2. Use the `Files` tab to create  a `data` folder to hold the data, a `scripts`
folder to house your scripts, and a `results` folder to hold results.
Alternatively, you can copy and paste the following commands into the `R`
console for step 2 only. You still need to create a project with step 1.

~~~
dir.create("data")
dir.create("scripts")
dir.create("results")
~~~
{: .r}

## Data Download

**Before the workshop**, please download the following files:

TBD: Users will download a subset of the counts and metadata from
somewhere (Box?). So far, 25% of the full data from liveratlas.org seems
to work well.

> DAS: Add some code here to download the file into `data`.
~~~
download.file(url = '', destfile = 'data/name_of_data.rds')
~~~
{: .r}
