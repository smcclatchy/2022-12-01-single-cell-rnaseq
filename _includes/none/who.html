  sequence analysis for resolving cell heterogeneity by exploring gene
  expression profiles at a single-cell resolution.
  <strong>
    Prerequisites:
  </strong>
  R programming skills are required for successful participation.
  If you can manipulate R data structures (e.g. lists, matrices, data frames) you are
  ready for this course.
  Knowledge of genetics and statistics will also help you gain the most from this course.
  To ensure that all participants receive the support that they need during training,
  <b>remote participation will not be made available</b>. You must attend in person and
  on-site.
